# Daily Motivation Quotes Project

## Overview
This project is dedicated to curating and delivering a diverse collection of carefully selected motivational quotes. The quotes are sourced from various outlets including the Good Reads website, which boasts an extensive compilation of quotes spanning various genres and themes. The goal is to provide users with daily updates featuring thoughtfully chosen quotes to inspire, encourage, and empower them in their everyday lives.
